# Guide to Contributing.

## Commits

Make sure to use clear and understandable commit messages.

## Branches

When you want to contribute, create a branch named: "dev-{name}-{number}" 
where "name" is your github username and "number" is the count of the contributions you have made, 
this is just to make sure we do not have duplicate branch names

## Pull Requests

Give a clear description of what you have done and why you have done so.
Pull requests will be denied if the above instructions are not followed.
If you wish to be included in the README file, make sure to add your own information,
we will NOT add your name for you.
